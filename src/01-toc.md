<!-- 
    Intro slides (1 of 1): Table of contents (TOC).

    TOC is added manually (not using toc: true in YAML header), to add some flexibility:
    - To make the TOC look better on a slide, a space is added before and after it.
    - If the TOC is too long, you can split it to multiple slides or columns by using sections parameter.
